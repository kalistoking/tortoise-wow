.SYNOPSIS
    Automated testlab pipeline for Tortoise-WoW and Playerbots compilation and deployment.

    Canonical home: https://github.com/kalistoking/tortoise-wow, tools/testlab_pipeline. This
    is the only place this script is maintained; it is not part of tortoise-wow/tortoise-wow
    (the engine) or any bot module's own repository, and copies elsewhere go stale.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the full deployment workflow, including client data verification,
    vcpkg dependency check, Git synchronization with submodules, CMake/MSBuild compilation,
    directory restructuring, configuration tuning, and automated database generation.

    Every parameter is optional and every default is the one this testlab uses, so a plain
    run needs no arguments at all. PowerShell renders the SYNTAX block above as one long
    line whatever the source looks like; the same parameters, grouped by what they do:

      Run mode
        -SkipBotRegen             keep accounts, characters and playerbot data
        -applyPatches             "hash1;hash2" to cherry-pick before building

      Where things live
        -WorkspaceRoot            testlab root            (default: this script's folder)
        -VcpkgDirectory           vcpkg                   (default: discovered)
        -VcpkgTriplet             vcpkg triplet           (default: x64-windows)

      What to build
        -RepoUrl                  repository              (default: tortoise-wow/tortoise-wow)
        -BranchName               branch                  (default: main)
        -PatchRemoteUrl           remote for -applyPatches
        -PlayerBotsRepoUrl        bot module source
                                  (default: Sagiroth/TortoiseBots)
        -PlayerBotsBranch         (default: main)

      Which database server
        -DbFlavor                 Auto | MariaDB | MySQL  (default: Auto)
        -MariaDbFolderName        portable server folder inside server\
        -MariaDbClientPath        explicit mariadb.exe / mysql.exe
        -DbHost  -DbPort          connection target       (default: the client's own)
        -DbStartupTimeoutSeconds  wait for it to start    (default: 30)

      Database identity
        -RootPassword             root password           (default: mangos)
        -DbUser  -DbPassword      the server's account    (default: mangos / mangos)
        -DbAccountHost            where that account may
                                  connect from            (default: from -DbHost)
        -DbPrefix                 names all four          (default: tw_)
        -WorldDatabaseName  -CharacterDatabaseName
        -LoginDatabaseName  -LogsDatabaseName
                                  override one name       (default: from the prefix)

      Realm and bots
        -RealmlistIPAddress  -RealmlistPort               (default: 127.0.0.1 / 8090)
        -MinRandomBots  -MaxRandomBots                    (default: 5 / 10)
        -RandomBotMinLevel  -RandomBotMaxLevel            (default: 1 / 20)
        -RandomBotAccountsCount                           (default: 10)

      Server logging
        -EnableSqlLog             every SQL query to file (default: off)
        -LogLevel                 0 Minimum | 1 Basic&Error
                                  | 2 Detail | 3 Full/Debug (default: 0)

      Server access
        -ForcePinAccountRank      lowest GM rank forced to a
                                  login PIN/2FA prompt      (default: 6)

      Database-only mode
        -DatabaseOnly             skip git/build/folders/config, touch only
                                  the databases (default: off)

      Modules
        -WithPlayerBots           add the bot module from
                                  -PlayerBotsRepoUrl (default: off)
        -UsePch                   build with precompiled headers, for a
                                  module that needs them (default: off)

    Use "Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1 -Parameter <name>" for the detail on any one of them,
    or -Examples for the common combinations.
.PARAMETER SkipBotRegen
    Preserves existing accounts, GM characters and playerbot data. 'tw_char' and 'tw_logon'
    are dumped before the run and restored at the end; the dump is verified before anything
    destructive happens, so a failed backup stops the pipeline with the data still intact.
    Without it every database is dropped and rebuilt from scratch.
.PARAMETER DatabaseOnly
    Touches only the databases: no git update, no compilation, no folder cleanup, no
    config file changes. Everything that already exists - the server binaries, etc\,
    the launcher .bat files - is left exactly as it is. Use it to re-test a change to
    sql/base or a new migration against a genuine first boot, without waiting for a
    full rebuild. Combine with -SkipBotRegen to reset only 'tw_world' (tw_char and
    tw_logon are backed up and restored, untouched in effect) - the "tw_world
    First-Boot Reset" case; without -SkipBotRegen all four databases are dropped and
    rebuilt, same as a full run's database step. Start the server yourself afterwards
    (the existing launcher .bat files) - that boot is the actual test: an empty
    'migrations' table means the DB Auto-Updater applies every migration exactly as
    it would on a brand-new install.
.PARAMETER applyPatches
    Semicolon-separated list of things to cherry-pick onto the branch before building,
    fetched from -PatchRemoteUrl. Each entry is either a commit hash or the name of a branch
    or tag: "0ee0748;abc1234" applies two commits, "my-fix-branch" applies every commit that
    branch has and the checkout does not, oldest first. Uncommitted local changes are stashed
    first, never discarded, and a cherry-pick that conflicts stops the run before anything is
    built - which makes this the way to answer "does my pull request still apply", by pointing
    -RepoUrl at the repository it targets and naming the branch here. -PatchRemoteUrl accepts
    a local path as readily as a URL, so a branch that has not been pushed anywhere can be
    tested straight out of another checkout on the same machine.
.PARAMETER WithPlayerBots
    Adds the bot module from -PlayerBotsRepoUrl on top of the engine: syncs its directories
    into modules\, imports whatever SQL it carries, and configures CMake to build it.
    Without it the run builds the engine alone, which is what the default -RepoUrl carries -
    it has no modules in it at all, so a default run is a plain core build and validating a
    core change needs nothing else. -WithBots is the old spelling of this switch, from when
    Shyalya's fork was the only source of bots; it still works, and now defaults to
    -PlayerBotsRepoUrl's own default (Sagiroth/TortoiseBots) rather than to Shyalya, which is
    being retired - see -PlayerBotsRepoUrl.
    Nothing about which module this is gets hard-coded. The module directory name comes from
    the repository, the CMake variable is derived from that name the same way the module
    system derives it (mod-playerbots to MODULE_MOD_PLAYERBOTS, TortoiseBots to
    MODULE_TORTOISEBOTS), and the SQL is whatever the module actually ships.
    Worth knowing before combining this with -DatabaseOnly: a database rebuilt without
    -WithPlayerBots has no bot tables in it, and a server binary that WAS built with a bot
    module dies on the missing tables at startup rather than reporting anything useful. The
    run warns when it sees that combination coming.
.PARAMETER UsePch
    Builds with precompiled headers on. Off by default, and off is what this script has
    always done, because turning the PCH off is the usual way out of MSVC's limit on how
    large a .pch may get here.
    That works because the core replaces the precompiled header with a force-include of the
    same header: src/game and src/scripts do it for themselves, and mod-playerbots does it
    for its own sources through botpch.h. modules/CMakeLists.txt does neither, so a module
    whose headers assume the precompiled set is in scope - rather than including what they
    use - only compiles when a PCH is genuinely being built. The symptom is hundreds of
    errors starting with "'string' is not a member of 'std'" in the module's own headers.
    Pass this when that is what you are looking at. The trade is the .pch size limit coming
    back, which is what turning it off avoided in the first place.
.PARAMETER WorkspaceRoot
    The testlab root: the folder holding 'server\' and the 'tortoise-wow\' checkout.
    Defaults to the folder this script sits in. Relative paths are resolved against your
    current directory. Everything else the pipeline touches is derived from this one path.
.PARAMETER VcpkgDirectory
    vcpkg installation providing ACE and Boost. Left empty it is discovered: VCPKG_ROOT,
    then vcpkg.exe on PATH, then conventional locations. Given explicitly it is used or the
    run fails - never silently replaced by a discovered one.
.PARAMETER VcpkgTriplet
    vcpkg triplet the dependencies are installed for. Defaults to x64-windows; the build
    itself is always -A x64.
.PARAMETER RootPassword
    Password for the database 'root' account, used for schema creation and imports.
.PARAMETER DbPassword
    Password for the 'mangos' service account this script creates and the server logs in
    with. Written to the database, not to any configuration file.
.PARAMETER DbUser
    Account the server logs in with. Created and granted in step 06, and written into the
    connection strings in mangosd.conf and realmd.conf.
.PARAMETER DbAccountHost
    Host part of the service account step 06 creates - the 'localhost' in
    'mangos'@'localhost'. Empty (default) derives it from -DbHost: 'localhost' for a local
    server, '%' for a remote one, because a remote server sees this machine arriving from
    its own address and never as localhost. Set it explicitly to narrow that down, e.g.
    -DbAccountHost "192.168.1.%".
.PARAMETER DbPrefix
    Prefix for the four database names, default "tw_". Change it to run several testlabs
    against one database server without them overwriting each other - -DbPrefix "lab2_"
    gives lab2_world, lab2_char, lab2_logon and lab2_logs. The schema is renamed on import
    and the server's connection strings are written to match.
.PARAMETER WorldDatabaseName
    Overrides the world database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>world".
.PARAMETER CharacterDatabaseName
    Overrides the characters database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>char".
.PARAMETER LoginDatabaseName
    Overrides the login/realm database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>logon".
.PARAMETER LogsDatabaseName
    Overrides the logs database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>logs".
.PARAMETER DbFlavor
    Which engine to look for: Auto (default), MariaDB or MySQL. Only narrows discovery -
    useful on a machine that has both installed.
.PARAMETER MariaDbFolderName
    Name of the portable MariaDB directory inside 'server\', tried before PATH and the
    conventional install locations.
.PARAMETER MariaDbClientPath
    Explicit path to mariadb.exe or mysql.exe. Given, it is used or the run fails, because
    connecting to a different server than intended means dropping databases on the wrong
    instance.
.PARAMETER DbHost
    Host to connect to. Empty (default) means the client's own default, which is what the
    bundled portable server wants.
.PARAMETER DbPort
    Port to connect to. 0 (default) means the client's own default.
.PARAMETER DbStartupTimeoutSeconds
    How long the preflight waits for the server to start answering, in seconds. Default 30.
    'server\1.Start mysql.bat' launches mysqld asynchronously, so a run started right after
    it needs a moment. A wrong password is never retried.
.PARAMETER RepoUrl
    Source repository to clone or pull.
.PARAMETER BranchName
    Branch to build. Point it at a topic branch to test one without editing anything.
.PARAMETER PatchRemoteUrl
    Remote the -applyPatches commits are fetched from.
.PARAMETER PlayerBotsRepoUrl
    Repository the bot module is synced from, independently of -RepoUrl: -RepoUrl points at
    the engine, this points at wherever the module lives. Only read under -WithPlayerBots.
    Defaults to Sagiroth/TortoiseBots, the primary bot module going forward - a from-scratch
    module built against the engine's own bot-helpers branch, not a fork of the engine itself.
    Two repository shapes are understood, and which one a repository is gets worked out by
    looking at the clone rather than by being told:
      a repository that is itself one module - taken whole and named after the repository,
        which is how Sagiroth/TortoiseBots provides TortoiseBots. This is the shape a new
        module should use.
      a core repository that carries modules - every modules\<name> holding a src\ is taken
        as a module. DEPRECATED: this is Shyalya's shape (mod-playerbots, mod-dungeon-clear),
        kept only so an existing -ModulesRepoUrl pointed at Shyalya still works while Shyalya
        winds down; using it prints a deprecation warning. Shyalya's own fork is retiring -
        synced with upstream only through 30 September 2026, then archived read-only - and
        this branch of the function is scheduled for removal once nothing needs it.
    The whole module directory is mirrored, its SQL included, so nothing extra is needed to
    carry a module's own database content across. -ModulesRepoUrl is the old spelling, from
    when Shyalya was the only source; it still works and still prints a deprecation notice.
.PARAMETER PlayerBotsBranch
    Branch -PlayerBotsRepoUrl is read from. Defaults to main, matching Sagiroth/TortoiseBots.
    -ModulesBranch is the old spelling.
.PARAMETER RealmlistIPAddress
    Address written into tw_logon.realmlist, and the one your client's realmlist.wtf has to
    point at.
.PARAMETER RealmlistPort
    Port written into tw_logon.realmlist. Must match WorldServerPort in mangosd.conf, which
    ships as 8090; a mismatch lets login succeed and then hangs the client before character
    selection.
.PARAMETER MinRandomBots
    Lower bound of the playerbot population written into aiplayerbot.conf.
.PARAMETER MaxRandomBots
    Upper bound of the playerbot population. The shipped template asks for a thousand, which
    turns the first start into a long wait for no benefit.
.PARAMETER RandomBotMinLevel
    Lowest level random bots are generated at.
.PARAMETER RandomBotMaxLevel
    Highest level random bots are generated at.
.PARAMETER RandomBotAccountsCount
    Number of bot accounts to create.
.PARAMETER EnableSqlLog
    Writes every SQL statement mangosd sends to a log file (LogSQL in mangosd.conf). Off by
    default: at LogSQL = 1 it is 94% of a normal run's console log, most of it the
    per-connection 'SET NAMES' / 'SET CHARACTER SET' every pooled database connection issues
    on open - not an error, just noise that buries the handful of lines that matter. Turn it
    on when you are chasing a specific query, e.g. a deadlock.
.PARAMETER LogLevel
    Console/log verbosity for mangosd and realmd: 0 Minimum, 1 Basic & Error, 2 Detail,
    3 Full/Debug. Defaults to 0; the shipped templates default to 1. This does not affect
    the DB content warnings step 01 and mangosd's table loader print on startup (missing
    creature_movement paths and the like) - those come from the world database's own
    content, not from this setting, and stay visible at every level.
.PARAMETER ForcePinAccountRank
    Lowest GM security rank realmd forces a login PIN/2FA prompt onto - the comparison in
    AuthSocket.cpp is securityRank >= this value, so a lower number catches more accounts.
    realmd.conf ships this at 1, which reaches every rank above a plain player
    (SEC_MODERATOR = 2 and up, including SEC_ADMINISTRATOR = 4 - src/shared/Common.h).
    Defaults here to 6 (SEC_CONSOLE, the highest rank this core defines) instead, so a
    testlab's own GM/Admin account is not stopped by a PIN prompt it never set up on a
    machine nobody else can reach. Set it to 1 to restore the shipped default, or to
    whatever rank should actually be gated.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat
    The normal run: builds everything and rebuilds every database from scratch. Use the .bat
    rather than the .ps1 so no execution-policy change is needed.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -SkipBotRegen
    Rebuilds the server but keeps your accounts, GM characters and playerbot data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -RepoUrl https://github.com/me/tortoise-wow.git -BranchName my-fix
    Builds a fork or topic branch without editing the script.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\testlab -VcpkgDirectory D:\vcpkg
    Runs the script straight out of the repository against a testlab folder elsewhere.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -DbFlavor MySQL -DbPort 3307 -RootPassword "hunter2"
    Uses an installed MySQL on a non-default port instead of the bundled portable MariaDB.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -applyPatches "0ee0748;abc1234" -SkipBotRegen
    Cherry-picks two hotfixes onto the branch, then rebuilds while preserving character data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\lab2 -DbPrefix "lab2_" -RealmlistPort 8091
    A second, independent testlab on the same machine and the same database server.
.NOTES
    Windows only (PowerShell 5.1+, Visual Studio 2022, CMake). See README.md next to this
    script for the folder layout it expects and what you have to supply yourself.

    Everything printed is also written to 'pipeline_console.log' in the workspace root, and
    the compiler output additionally to 'server_build.log'. No shell redirection needed.

    A wrap-point gotcha in this comment block, for whoever next reformats a paragraph here:
    Get-Help's comment-based-help parser treats any line that starts with a bare period
    (after leading whitespace) as a new section keyword, whether or not it recognises the
    word after the dot. Wrapping -DatabaseOnly's description once put ".bat files ..." at
    the start of a line, and every parameter after it in Get-Help silently vanished - the
    script still ran fine, only its own documentation broke. Keep a non-period word first
    on every wrapped line.
